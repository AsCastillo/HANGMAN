SCHOOL PROJECT

AGILE METHOD PROGRAMMING

MISSION : Remember when you were in Elementary school and you had to memorize all 50 states for history class?
          Now you can test your knowledge while also playing a game!!
          This is a perfect way to test your memory but also your spelling because with each letter you get wrong the closer you are to losing.
